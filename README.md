## 🧪 API Testing

  - Error handling and validation checks

## 📬 Contact Form Workflow

1. **User Input:** Name, email, and message fields with client-side validation.
2. **Form Submission:** Data is sent to a Node.js/Express API via a POST request.
3. **Validation & Storage:** Input is validated server-side and stored in MongoDB.
4. **Response:** The user receives success or error feedback based on the response.
